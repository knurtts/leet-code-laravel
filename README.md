# Project Description

This space is intended as a Laravel/Vue playground and practice area. I use it to implement solutions to Leet-code problems in laravel, and I will be implementing front-end components that I find interesting.

## Get it running locally

This assumes that you have php and Laravel installed locally already. If not follow the instructions at [Laravel.com](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation)

```
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan key:generate
npm install && npm run build
composer run dev
```
